* Description

This layer setups Emacs for working with flow files. It provides syntax checking
throught ~flycheck-flow~, and autocompletion throught ~company-flow~. You also
can use check types and jump to definition of symbols using ~flow-minor-mode~.

It has some problems, like not working properly with the javascript layer.

* Install

Run =git clone https://github.com/stevenremot/spacemacs-layer-flow.git ~/.emacs.d/private/flow/=.
Then declare the flow layer in your ~.spacemacs~.
